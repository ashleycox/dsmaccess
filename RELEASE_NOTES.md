## v1.1-beta.5 (build 6) — 2026-07-19

### Highlights

- Fixes a sign-in problem introduced in beta.4: approving your NAS certificate
  now works, instead of the trust prompt coming back again and again.

### Fixes

- When macOS does not recognise your NAS certificate, approving it once now signs
  you in on the first try, and the choice is remembered for that server. In
  beta.4 the approval did not take, so the trust prompt kept reappearing and left
  you stuck on the sign-in screen.

### Thanks

- Thanks to Ashley Cox, who tracked this down and fixed it.

### Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.
- A Synology NAS running DSM 7 on your local network.
